# Welcome to arykdev.github.io!

# This site hasn't been updated in a few months, and can be considered abandoned now, don't expect anything new here.

### About Me
My name is Jack Eilles, I am a T-Level DPDD Student at New College Durham with experience in Proxmox, Python 3, Linux Servers, and much [more](portfolio.md).
This website will contain all of my current projects, as well as ongoing projects, along with some guides as well.

Currently, my main programming language is Python 3, however I would like to work on learning others in the future, like C++, Java, etc...
I also have experience in HTML and CSS, and I'm currently working on understanding Javascript.

### Current Projects

Recently, I have been working on a terminal utility for the command `kexec`, to assist in helping people use it without needing to type in a massive command.
Currently the program is quite limited, only being able to reboot the currently running kernel, however I am figuring out how to detect every kernel installed and add a selection menu.

I have also been attempting to create a Linux shell based on Python 3, however I feel that it might need to be rewritten in another language, which would ruin the entire basis of the project, if anyone knows how I could have a Python program as a binary file in Linux, please E-Mail me.

### Past Projects

At one point, I was beginning work on a new Social Media website, on the basis of it not being as addictive as other platforms, by making it solely text based, with no photo, video, audio, or texting support, however during development, I lost the files on my hard drive and was unable to recover them, and I also realised I didn't have the necessary technical skills to develop it, so the project has been halted for now.

### Future Projects

Recently I have been drafting up an idea for a terminal program which will teach new users of the shell commands and utility usage through an easy to use and understand TUI program, there will be different variations for different shells, like BASH, ZSH, FISH, etc...
Could probably keep track of a users progress through an XML file or something, not sure though, I'd probably have to read about it.
